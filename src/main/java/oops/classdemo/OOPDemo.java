    Variables
   1. Static variables
   2. Non ststic variables  or instance variables


   Q. how to declare the static and not static variables?

   Static variables declaration??
    - static variables are declared with static key word
        ex : static int i;

    - static varibales are belong to class
    - static members are only per class



    Non static variables??
     - the variable declare within class called non-static variabless
       ex : int i;

     - non - static variables are belong to object
     - each object has its own copy of non-static members
